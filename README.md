# Django React To-Do List

This simple web application serves as a practical exploration of authentication and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality using Django and React. It provides a straightforward and interactive To-Do List where users can create, view, edit, and delete tasks.

## Features

- User Authentication: Secure user registration and login functionality.
- To-Do List Management: Easily add, edit, and remove tasks.

This project is an excellent starting point for understanding the integration of Django and React in a real-world application, demonstrating the core concepts of user management and data manipulation.
